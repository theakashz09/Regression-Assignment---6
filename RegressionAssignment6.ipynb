        "2. Dataset Cleaning,Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering : Then we clean the data ie.remove outliers,fill null values and convert categorical to Numerical Datatypes and select only the relevent features for model training.\n",
        "3. Model Training and Evaluation : This involves selecting an appropriate model, training the model on the data, and evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.The final model selected is then coverted to pickle file for further use in the web app.\n",
        "4. Web Application Development : This involves building a web interface that allows users to input data, processing user inputs, and making predictions using the trained model.The pickled file embedded in the flask web app predicts based on the input data.\n",
        "5. Cloud Deployment : This involves setting up the infrastructure on the cloud provider, configuring the application servers, and deploying the code. For example for deploying in AWS we use elastic beanstalk and codepipeline we add .eb extensions file.\n",
        "6. Monitor and Maintain : Once the application is live, it's important to monitor it regularly to ensure it's performing as expected. This includes monitoring for errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, maintenance is required to ensure the application remains up-to-date with the latest security patches and features.\n"
